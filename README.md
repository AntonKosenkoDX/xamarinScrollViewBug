### Xamarin.Forms ScrollView Layout bug

How to reproduce:
1. Build and run app targets on Android
2. Click on "Click me!" button
3. Now you see several new entries below the button. You also can scroll down and if you do this an empty space will be below recently appeared entries.
4. If you type text into any entry then missing entries will appear in the empty space.
